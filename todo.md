### 2.3. Database Design, Implementation, and Initial Population
*   [x] Design database schema (Saved to database_schema.sql).
*   [x] Set up and configure PostgreSQL database (meme_coin_db created, user manus_user created).
*   [x] Apply initial schema to the database.
*   [x] Populate database with initial sample data (Twitter data - 1 record, containing an API error response).
*   [x] Validate initial data insertion and retrieval.
*   [ ] Implement data versioning, backups, and archival strategies (Future task).a Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Validation
*   [ ] Develop data cleaning scripts.
*   [ ] Implement data transformation processes.
*   [ ] Define and implement data validation rules.

*   [ ] Implement interactive data visualizations.
*   [ ] Develop an alerting system.
*   [ ] Ensure responsive design.

### 4.3. User Authentication and Profile Management (Optional)
*   [ ] Implement if required.

## Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, and Iteration (Weeks 37-40 and Ongoing)

### 5.1. Comprehensive Testing
*   [ ] Conduct Unit Testing.
*   [ ] Conduct Integration Testing.
*   [ ] Conduct End-to-End Testing.
*   [ ] Conduct Performance Testing.
*   [ ] Conduct Security Testing.
*   [ ] Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

### 5.2. Deployment
*   [ ] Prepare production environment.
*   [ ] Deploy backend application.
*   [ ] Deploy React frontend application.
*   [ ] Configure domain and SSL.

### 5.3. Monitoring,## Phase 3: Analytical Model Development and Backend Implementation (COMPLETE)

This phase focused on engineering features, developing AI/ML models, creating an integrated analytical framework, and building a backend API to serve the results.


## Phase 4: Frontend Development and Integration (Weeks 25-36)

This phase focuses on designing and developing the user-facing React application, integrating it with the backend API, and ensuring a functional and user-friendly interface for accessing the meme coin pattern recognition insights. It corresponds to Section V of the original document and the user's preference for a React-based web application.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Design an intuitive UI/UX for displaying analytical results and alerts.
*   Develop a responsive React application.
*   Integrate the frontend with the Flask backend API.
*   Ensure the platform is testable and ready for initial user feedback.

**Deliverables:**
*   UI/UX design mockups or descriptions.
*   React frontend codebase.
*   Integrated frontend and backend system (running locally or on a staging environment).
*   Updated `todo.md` and project documentation.

### 4.1. UI/UX Design
*   [x] Define user personas and key user flows (Initial draft in ui_ux_considerations.md).
*   [x] Create wireframes or mockups for core application views (Conceptual descriptions in ui_ux_considerations.md).
*   [x] Plan data visualization strategies (Initial thoughts in ui_ux_considerations.md).

### 4.2. Frontend Project Setup
*   [x] Initialize React project using `create_react_app` (meme_coin_frontend created).
*   [x] Set up project structure (components, services, state management) - Initial structure by create_react_app.
*   [x] Install necessary frontend libraries (e.g., Zustand for state, Recharts for charts, Axios for API calls) - Zustand, Recharts, Axios installed.

### 4.3. Core Frontend Component Development
*   [x] Develop main layout components (navigation, header, footer, sidebar).
*   [x] Develop components for displaying lists of coins/alerts (CoinListPage.jsx with placeholders).
*   [x] Develop components for detailed coin views (CoinDetailPage.jsx with placeholders).
*   [x] Develop initial dashboard view (DashboardPage.jsx with placeholders).
*   [ ] Develop components for data visualizations (LATER - will integrate with API data).
### 4.4. Frontend-Backend Integration
*   [x] Implement API service calls to fetch data from the Flask backend (apiService.js created).
*   [x] Manage application state with fetched data (using Zustand - coinStore.js created).
*   [x] Update CoinListPage to fetch and display API data.
*   [x] Update DashboardPage and CoinDetailPage to use API data (LATER).
*   [x] Handle API errors and loading states gracefully (Initial implementation in CoinListPage and coinStore).
### 4.5. Testing and Validation
*   [ ] Conduct component testing.
*   [ ] Perform integration testing between frontend and backend.
*   [ ] Ensure responsive design across different screen sizes.
*   [ ] User acceptance testing (UAT) with the user.
