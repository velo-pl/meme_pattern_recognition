# Project Document Summary

Date: May 14, 2025

This document summarizes the key findings from the project documents provided by the user on May 14, 2025. The primary goal is to ensure alignment with the latest project plans, requirements, and priorities.

## 1. Core Project Documents Reviewed:

*   `implementation_plan.md`: Provides a comprehensive, phased roadmap for the entire project, from initial setup to deployment and ongoing iteration. It details objectives, technology stack, data strategy, analytical model development, frontend/backend development, testing, and deployment.
*   `todo.md`: This appears to be the central task tracking document, outlining progress across different phases. The version provided in the zip file will be considered the source of truth for current progress.
*   `ui_ux_considerations.md`: Details user personas (Primary: Alex - Community Analyst), key user flows (Dashboard, Coin Exploration, Detailed Coin Analysis), conceptual wireframes for core views (Dashboard, Coin List, Coin Detail), data visualization strategies, and key UI/UX principles (clarity, actionable insights, responsiveness, performance, trust).
*   `visualization_plan.md`: Outlines specific data visualizations for the Dashboard and Coin Detail pages using Recharts, based on data from `integrated_scores.csv`. Details chart types (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, radar charts, gauge charts), their purpose, and insights they aim to provide.
*   `dashboard_page_test_plan.md`: Provides a detailed test plan for the `DashboardPage` chart components, including specific test cases for summary statistics and various charts (Score Distribution, Radar Chart, Top Promising Coins), and general page tests.
*   `dashboard_coindetail_data_requirements.md`: Specifies the data needed for the `DashboardPage` and `CoinDetailPage` from `integrated_scores.csv` and how it maps to UI elements. It also highlights the need for a new API endpoint (`/api/v1/scores/<identifier>`) for the Coin Detail Page.

## 2. Key Overall Findings & Implications:

*   **Comprehensive Planning:** The project is well-documented with detailed plans for each phase.
*   **User-Centric Design:** UI/UX considerations are clearly defined with a focus on an analyst persona.
*   **Data-Driven Visualizations:** Specific plans exist for data visualizations on key pages, leveraging the `integrated_scores.csv` dataset.
*   **Structured Testing:** A clear test plan for the Dashboard page charts was provided.
*   **API Requirements:** The need for a new backend API endpoint for coin details is explicitly stated.
*   **`todo.md` as Source of Truth:** The `todo.md` from the provided zip file should supersede any previous versions I was working with to reflect the actual current state of the project from the user's perspective.

## 3. Alignment with Previous Work:

*   The work done on implementing Dashboard visualizations and their testing seems to align with the general direction outlined in these documents.
*   The technology stack (Flask backend, React frontend, Recharts) is consistent.
*   The focus on `integrated_scores.csv` as the primary data source for the frontend is also consistent.

## 4. Immediate Next Steps based on Documents:

*   **Synchronize `todo.md`:** Ensure my working `todo.md` matches the one provided in the zip file.
*   **Coin Detail Page Development:** Based on the `todo.md` and other plans, the next major development effort after Dashboard visualizations would likely be the `CoinDetailPage` visualizations and integration.
*   **Backend API for Coin Detail:** The backend API endpoint `/api/v1/scores/<identifier>` needs to be implemented if not already present (the documents suggest it was planned as a *new* endpoint for this phase).
*   **Continue Frontend Development:** Proceed with implementing features as outlined in the `implementation_plan.md` and `todo.md`, particularly focusing on Phase 4 (Frontend Development and Integration).

This summary will be used to update the overall project plan and to confirm the next steps with the user.
