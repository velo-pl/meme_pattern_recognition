# Data Pipeline Automation Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for automating the data collection, cleaning, and processing pipelines for the Meme Coin Pattern Recognition Platform. Automation is crucial for ensuring a continuous flow of fresh data for analysis and model operation.

## 1. Overview of Pipelines to Automate

The key pipelines requiring automation are:

1.  **Data Collection:**
    *   Twitter Data Collector (`twitter_data_collector.py` - assuming this exists or will be developed based on project docs)
    *   Yahoo Finance Data Collectors (e.g., `yahoo_finance_chart_collector.py`, `yahoo_finance_holders_collector.py`, etc.)
    *   Etherscan Data Collector (`etherscan_data_collector.py`)
    *   Web Scrapers (e.g., `web_scraper_fundamentals.py`)
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    *   `data_cleaning_processor.py`: To clean and standardize data from all sources.
3.  **Analytical Model Execution (Optional for full automation, depending on use case):**
    *   `sentiment_analyzer.py`
    *   `onchain_anomaly_detector.py`
    *   `risk_flagger.py`
    *   (Potentially) The script that generates `integrated_scores.csv` for the backend.

## 2. Automation Goals

*   **Regularity:** Ensure data is collected and processed at appropriate intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, depending on the source and data volatility).
*   **Reliability:** Automated jobs should be robust, with error handling, logging, and alerting mechanisms.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimize manual intervention and optimize resource usage.
*   **Scalability:** The automation solution should be able to handle increasing numbers of data sources or increased frequency of execution.
*   **Monitoring:** Ability to monitor the status and health of automated jobs.

## 3. Proposed Automation Solutions

These solutions align with the options discussed in the `deployment_strategy.md` for running scripts.

### 3.1. Scheduling Mechanisms

*   **Option A: Cron Jobs (on a Dedicated Server/VM)**
    *   **Description:** Use the standard Unix cron utility to schedule the execution of Python scripts.
    *   **Pros:** Simple to set up for basic scheduling, widely understood, good for scripts running on a single machine.
    *   **Cons:** Limited to a single machine (potential single point of failure unless HA is set up for the VM), managing dependencies and environments for many scripts can become complex, logging and monitoring are basic unless custom solutions are built.
    *   **Implementation:** Each data collection and processing script would have a corresponding cron entry defining its schedule.

*   **Option B: Serverless Functions with Schedulers (e.g., AWS Lambda + CloudWatch Events, Google Cloud Functions + Cloud Scheduler, Azure Functions + Timer Trigger)**
    *   **Description:** Package scripts (or parts of them) as serverless functions and trigger them on a schedule.
    *   **Pros:** Highly scalable, pay-per-use (cost-effective for infrequent jobs), managed environment, built-in logging and monitoring (e.g., via CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging/Monitoring).
    *   **Cons:** Scripts might need refactoring to fit serverless constraints (execution time limits, statelessness, dependency packaging). Cold starts can sometimes introduce latency for the first invocation after a period of inactivity.
    *   **Implementation:** Each script or a logical group of scripts becomes a function. Schedulers are configured to invoke these functions.

*   **Option C: Workflow Orchestration Tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, AWS Step Functions, Google Cloud Composer, Azure Data Factory/Logic Apps)**
    *   **Description:** Designed for defining, scheduling, and monitoring complex data workflows (DAGs - Directed Acyclic Graphs).
    *   **Pros:** Excellent for managing dependencies between tasks (e.g., run cleaning only after collection is successful), robust error handling and retry mechanisms, detailed logging and UI for monitoring, versioning of workflows.
    *   **Cons:** Can have a steeper learning curve and more setup overhead than simple cron jobs or basic serverless functions. Managed services can be more expensive for simple workloads.
    *   **Implementation:** Define DAGs where each node represents a script or a step in the pipeline. Airflow (or similar) manages the execution schedule and dependencies.

### 3.2. Considerations for Each Pipeline Stage

*   **Data Collection:**
    *   **Frequency:** Varies by source. Twitter might be near real-time or hourly. Financial data daily. On-chain data could be hourly or more frequent for active monitoring.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement retries for API failures, log errors, and potentially send alerts for persistent failures.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Respect API rate limits. Schedulers should be configured accordingly, or scripts should have internal logic to manage this.

*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    *   **Triggering:** Typically run after a data collection job (or a set of collection jobs) completes successfully.
    *   **Idempotency:** Cleaning scripts should ideally be idempotent (running them multiple times on the same raw data produces the same cleaned output).

*   **Analytical Model Execution:**
    *   **Triggering:** Can be scheduled (e.g., daily risk assessment) or triggered by the completion of data cleaning/preprocessing, or even on-demand via an API call if results are needed immediately.
    *   **Output Management:** Decide where the outputs of these models are stored (e.g., back into the PostgreSQL database, flat files in a storage bucket like S3/GCS).

## 4. Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

*   **Logging:** All automated scripts should produce detailed logs (e.g., start time, end time, records processed, errors encountered). Cloud platforms offer centralized logging services (CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging).
*   **Monitoring:** Track the success/failure of jobs, execution times, and resource usage. Cloud platforms provide monitoring dashboards.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for job failures, prolonged execution times, or critical errors (e.g., via email, SMS, or integration with tools like PagerDuty/Opsgenie).

## 5. Recommended Approach (Phased)

1.  **Phase 1 (Initial Automation):**
    *   If deploying on a dedicated VM/server, start with **cron jobs** for simplicity for data collection and cleaning scripts.
    *   If opting for a serverless-heavy architecture, use **Serverless Functions with Schedulers**.
    *   Implement robust logging within each script.

2.  **Phase 2 (Enhanced Automation & Orchestration):**
    *   As the number of scripts and their interdependencies grow, or if more complex scheduling and retry logic is needed, migrate to a **Workflow Orchestration Tool** like Apache Airflow (or its managed cloud equivalents).
    *   Implement more sophisticated monitoring and alerting.

## 6. Configuration Management

*   Schedules, API keys (managed securely), database credentials, and other configurations for automated jobs should be managed outside the scripts themselves (e.g., environment variables, configuration files deployed alongside scripts, or secrets management services).

## 7. Next Steps for Automation Planning

1.  **Finalize Deployment Environment:** The choice of automation tools will be heavily influenced by the chosen deployment environment for the scripts (VM vs. Serverless).
2.  **Define Specific Schedules:** Determine the exact frequency for each data collection and processing task.
3.  **Develop Error Handling & Retry Strategies:** For each script/job.
4.  **Implement Initial Scheduling:** Using the chosen mechanism (cron, serverless schedulers).
5.  **Set Up Basic Logging and Monitoring.**

This strategy provides a roadmap for automating the data pipelines, ensuring the platform has access to timely and clean data for its analytical functions.
