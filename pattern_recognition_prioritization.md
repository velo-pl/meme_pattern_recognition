# Pattern Recognition Model Development: Prioritization and Next Steps

This document outlines the prioritized plan for developing pattern recognition models, based on the `implementation_plan.md` and the current state of our data collection and cleaning capabilities.

## 1. Current Data Availability for Modeling

Following the expansion of our data collection pipelines and the implementation of initial data cleaning processes, we now have access to cleaned data from:

*   **Social Media:** Twitter data (tweets, user information) via `twitter_data_collector.py`.
*   **Financial Markets:** Yahoo Finance data (charts, holders, insights, SEC filings) via respective collectors.
*   **On-Chain (Ethereum):** Transaction data via `etherscan_data_collector.py`.
*   **Project Fundamentals (Basic):** Textual content from websites via `web_scraper_fundamentals.py`.

This data, once processed by `data_cleaning_processor.py`, provides a foundation for initial model development.

## 2. Prioritized Models for Initial Development

Based on the `implementation_plan.md` (Phase 3.2: AI and Advanced Analytics Model Development) and the available data, the following models are prioritized for initial development:

### Priority 1: Sentiment Analysis (NLP Model)
*   **Objective:** Analyze sentiment from Twitter data and scraped website text (e.g., project descriptions, news mentions if scraped) to gauge market perception and identify shifts in community attitude.
*   **Data Sources:** Cleaned Twitter data, cleaned text from `web_scraper_fundamentals.py`.
*   **Rationale:** Sentiment is a key driver in the meme coin market. This model is foundational for understanding social dynamics and can feed into more complex predictive or risk models.
*   **Initial Approach:** Utilize pre-trained NLP models (e.g., from Hugging Face Transformers library like VADER, RoBERTa for sentiment) for initial sentiment scoring. Fine-tuning can be considered later.

### Priority 2: On-Chain Anomaly Detection
*   **Objective:** Identify unusual patterns in on-chain transaction data from Etherscan, such as sudden spikes in volume, large transfers to/from exchange wallets, or patterns indicative of wash trading or rug pulls (e.g., rapid liquidity removal).
*   **Data Sources:** Cleaned Etherscan transaction data.
*   **Rationale:** On-chain data provides direct evidence of token activity. Detecting anomalies here is crucial for early warnings.
*   **Initial Approach:** Start with statistical methods to identify outliers in transaction volumes, frequency, and value. Explore clustering or time-series anomaly detection techniques as more data accumulates.

### Priority 3: Basic Risk Flag Identification (Component of Risk Modeling)
*   **Objective:** Develop a system to identify and flag specific, predefined red flags based on available data. This is an initial step towards a comprehensive risk score.
*   **Data Sources:** Combination of cleaned data from Yahoo Finance (e.g., lack of SEC filings for related entities if applicable, concentrated holder data), Etherscan (e.g., high concentration of tokens in a few wallets, suspicious initial distribution), and scraped project fundamentals (e.g., anonymous team, missing whitepaper - if we can reliably extract this).
*   **Rationale:** Provides an early, rule-based assessment of potential risks associated with a coin.
*   **Initial Approach:** Define a set of rules based on the red flags outlined in Table 3 of the `implementation_plan.md`. For example:
    *   If team is anonymous (from scraped data) -> Flag.
    *   If >X% of tokens held by top Y wallets (from Etherscan/holder data) -> Flag.
    *   If no clear whitepaper or roadmap (from scraped data) -> Flag.

## 3. Models for Subsequent Phases

Once the prioritized models are established and we have more mature data pipelines and feature engineering processes, we can tackle:

*   **Advanced Predictive Modeling:** For price pumps/dumps, project success/failure, potentially using multimodal approaches.
*   **Comprehensive Risk Scoring:** Integrating various flags and model outputs into a single, weighted risk score.
*   **Topic Modeling:** For deeper insights into community discussions.
*   **Technical Indicator Automation & AI Interpretation:** More sophisticated analysis of financial chart data.

## 4. Next Steps (Leading to Feature Engineering and Modeling - Plan Step 005)

1.  **Feature Engineering for Sentiment Analysis:** Define features from text data (e.g., sentiment scores, emotion scores, specific keywords/phrases).
2.  **Feature Engineering for On-Chain Anomaly Detection:** Define features from transaction data (e.g., transaction frequency, volume, value, gas prices, unique senders/receivers over time windows).
3.  **Feature Engineering for Risk Flags:** Define specific data points to extract for each identified red flag rule.
4.  **Select and Set Up Modeling Libraries:** Ensure necessary Python libraries (Scikit-learn, Transformers, NLTK, SpaCy, etc.) are installed and ready.
5.  **Develop Initial Model Scripts:** Start coding the prioritized models, beginning with data loading, feature extraction, and applying the initial modeling approaches outlined above.

This prioritization allows us to build foundational analytical capabilities with the data we have been focusing on collecting and cleaning, paving the way for more complex pattern recognition as the project progresses.
