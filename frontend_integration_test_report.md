## Frontend Integration Test Results and Findings

**Date:** 2025-05-14

**Objective:** Test the integration between the React frontend and the Flask backend, specifically the ability of the `CoinListPage` to fetch and display data from the `/api/v1/scores` endpoint.

**Summary of Test Execution:**

1.  **Server Setup:**
    *   The Vite React development server was started successfully on `http://localhost:5173/`.
    *   The Flask backend API server was started successfully on `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`.

2.  **Initial Frontend State:**
    *   Initially, the frontend was loading the default Vite + React template page.
    *   The `App.tsx` file was updated to render the custom `CoinListPage` component as the main application view.

3.  **API Integration - Network Error Resolution:**
    *   Upon loading the `CoinListPage`, an initial "Network Error" was encountered, preventing data fetching.
    *   Investigation revealed a likely Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue.
    *   The Flask backend was updated to include the `Flask-CORS` library and configured to allow requests from the frontend origin (`http://localhost:5173`).
    *   The `Flask-CORS` dependency was added to `requirements.txt` and installed.
    *   The backend server was restarted.

4.  **API Integration - Post-CORS Fix:**
    *   After implementing CORS, the "Network Error" was resolved.
    *   The frontend `CoinListPage` successfully communicated with the backend API.

5.  **Data Verification (Backend):**
    *   The backend data source, `/home/ubuntu/meme_coin_pattern_recognition_platform/engineered_features/integrated_scores.csv`, was verified to contain multiple records of integrated scores.

6.  **Current Frontend Display Issue:**
    *   Despite successful API communication and data being present in the backend, the `CoinListPage` currently displays the message: "No coins found."

**Key Findings:**

*   The core frontend and backend servers are operational.
*   The network communication channel between the frontend and backend is established and functional after resolving CORS issues.
*   The backend API is serving data from the `integrated_scores.csv` file.
*   The primary outstanding issue is that the frontend is not correctly displaying the fetched data, instead showing "No coins found."

**Potential Next Steps for Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Inspect Frontend Data Handling:** Review the data fetching and state management logic in `CoinListPage.jsx` and `src/store/coinStore.js`. Pay close attention to how the API response is processed and mapped to the component's state.
2.  **Check API Response Structure:** Verify that the structure of the JSON response from the `/api/v1/scores` endpoint (e.g., `{"scores": [...]}`) matches what the frontend `coinStore.js` expects (e.g., `response.data.scores`).
3.  **Browser Developer Console:** Examine the browser's developer console (Network tab and Console tab) when the `CoinListPage` loads. Look for:
    *   The actual API response received by the frontend.
    *   Any JavaScript errors occurring during data processing or rendering.
4.  **Debug Frontend Logic:** Use `console.log` statements or a debugger within the frontend code to trace the data flow from the API call through state updates to component rendering.
